<hr>
<p> I am wildly afraid to see what happens next, <br>
You’re never ready to leave home, <br>
Pulling on the ginger and laying the rails, <br>
Embrace your passing with a flower in hand, knowing it’s left all too late, <br>
Just tell them they weren’t ready. <br>
</p>

<p>
Pacing corridors with warm coils, <br>
Turned over, <br>
Filled with stammers of others and their sharp breaths, <br>
Sure of the steps next; dead to the present. <br>
</p>

<p> 
‘It will get worse before it gets better.’, <br>
Soon they will understand, <br>
They’ll grow so much - kicking and screaming the whole way, <br>
Do you think they know? <br>
Weaving the lines across the rooms, <br>
What were they thinking? <br>
Being a disciple throughout, <br>
Eating off the floor, <br>
Whispers of regret written on infancy, <br>
The stifled flames. <br>
</p>

<p> 
Effervescent pink, <br>
Stapled to my wall, <br>
The words lived-in, <br>
The hymn as evensong; <br> 
     <br>

   ‘Promise. Don't let yourself in <br>
    for this moment again: the end <br>
    of the afternoon, drawing the curtains, <br>
    on the glare of a garden, a whole <br>
    day of snow nobody’s trodden.’ <br>
</p>
